## Topics covered:
<dl>
<dt>1. Image Transformations</dt>
  <dd>Implementation of <i>Translation</i>, <i>Rotation</i> and <i>Shearing</i> operations.</dd>

<dt>2. Filtering and Convolution</dt>
  <dd>Exploring the effect of <i>Mean</i>, <i>Gaussian</i> and <i>Laplacian</i> kernels, as well as their combinations.</dd>
  
<dt>3. Colour Histogram</dt>
   <dd>Detecting changes on a video by using <i>colour/intensity histograms</i> and their intersections as image descriptors.</dd>
   
<dt>4. Motion Estimation</dt>
   <dd>Implementation of a full-search <i>Block Matching</i> algorithm for motion estimation.</dd>

<dt>5. Object Counting</dt>
   <dd>Generating a reference frame for a video, using a weighted temporal averaging algorithm. Number of objects on each frame can be estimated by counting connected components on a thresholded difference mask for a frame and a reference.</dd>

<dt>6. Texture Analysis</dt>
   <dd>Implementing a binary classifier, using <i>Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histogram</i> as an image descriptor.</dd>
